2.What did you think would be easy but was not?

  I thought that learning and implementing socket.io into our project would have been more difficult but it was surpassingly smooth.
4.What techniques did you successfully utilize to work in a team?
  We worked exclusively with paired programming. This worked surprisingly well, especially since we did not have to waste time with any github merge issues.

  Sockets! They are amazing!
6.What did you kick ass at?
  Life.
7.How did your project scope change?
  Our project scope did not change through out the day. We stayed true to our vision. We did have some functionality that we did not have enough time to implement.
